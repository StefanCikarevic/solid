# Solid

A forward-thinking library of web components.

- Works with all frameworks 🧩
- Works with CDNs 🚛
- Fully customizable with CSS 🎨
- Includes an official dark theme 🌛
- Built with accessibility in mind ♿️
- Open source 😸

Initially based on [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style), developed and designed in New Hampshire by [Cory LaViska](https://twitter.com/claviska).

## Testing

- `pnpm test` runs out of the box with no configuration
- If you want to run watch-tests, run `pnpm build:watch` in one terminal and `pnpm test:component <component-name>` in another. This will change in future, as soon as Vite handles the whole bundling etc.
